A major advantage of 'ggiraph' used in a shiny application is the ability to
collect selections. The user defines them by clicking on the elements or by
defining an area surrounding the elements to be selected (lasso selection).

It is also possible to deselect all or part of an existing selection. The
selection can be made by the user in several steps. It is possible to select a
set of elements, deselect some of them and select another set of elements.

Hover events can also be used as reactive.

Interactive feature with shiny are all available in the body of the graphic but
also in the legend and the titles.
