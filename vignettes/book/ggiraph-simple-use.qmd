# Makes ggplot dynamic {.unnumbered}

{{< include _init.qmd >}}

Most users do not want to use shiny but simply add some dynamic effects to their
ggplot graphics in order to display some tooltips, and/or add some highlighting
effects to the elements under the mouse cursor.

This part of the book gives you an overview of the main options available to add
dynamic effects to a 'ggplot' object and to define overall appearance.

We want you to understand:

- how to animate and customize animations in @sec-hover-opt and 
tooltips in @sec-tooltip-opt, 
- how to set up the toolbar in @sec-toolbar, 
- how to easily manage the fonts used in @sec-fonts,
- how to size the graphic in @sec-sizing.
